# Card-Based-web-template



With reference to the above image please note that the web-page has a card based layout
where the cards have fixed width while the height varies from card to card. However, in spite of
varying height, the cards are aligned vertically. As illustrated, the second row of card starts from
where the card on top of it ends, with a fixed margin between the two.

Task is to emulate this behaviour using only HTML and CSS(no JavaScript).
